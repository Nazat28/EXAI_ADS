**EXAI-ADS: On Evaluating Black-box Explainable AI Methods for Enhancing Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving Systems**

**Abstract:**
The recent advancement in autonomous driving comes with the associated cybersecurity issue of compromising networks of autonomous vehicles (AVs). This security issue motivates leveraging AI models for detecting anomalies on these networks of AVs. In this context, the usage of explainable AI (XAI) for explaining the behavior of these AI models that detect anomalies in networks of AVs is crucial. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to assess black-box XAI techniques in
the context of anomaly detection within autonomous vehicles. Our framework facilitates the examination of both global and local XAI methods, shedding light on the decisions made by XAI techniques that elucidate the behavior of AI models classifying anomalous autonomous vehicle behavior. By considering six evaluation metrics (descriptive accuracy, sparsity, stability, efficiency, robustness, and completeness), we conducted evaluations on two well-known black-box XAI techniques, SHAP and LIME. The evaluation process involved applying XAI techniques to identify primary features crucial for anomaly classification, followed by extensive experiments assessing SHAP and LIME across the specified six XAI evaluation metrics using two prevalent autonomous driving datasets, VeReMi and Sensor. This study marks a pivotal advancement in the deployment of black-box XAI methods for real-world anomaly detection in autonomous driving systems, contributing valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of current black-box XAI methods within this critical domain.

At a broad level, the pipeline will ingest raw autonomous driving datasets encompassing sensor, position, and speed data of an AV. These will be the main inputs into multiple black-box AI models to generate predictions (whether an AV has anomalous behavior or not). Subsequently, the predictions will be analyzed by XAI techniques (including SHAP and LIME) to produce model's top features and explanations. These  explanations will then be evaluated on the following six key dimensions: descriptive accuracy, sparsity, stability, efficiency, robustness, and completeness.

**Evaluation Results:**

1. Descriptive Accuracy:
The authors evaluated the descriptive accuracy of SHAP and LIME explanation methods on two datasets - VeReMi and Sensor - for autonomous driving models. Descriptive accuracy refers to the drop in model accuracy when removing the most influential features identified by the explanation methods. A greater drop implies the features are more explanatory. For VeReMi, SHAP outperformed LIME in terms of global explainability and causing a steeper decline in accuracy when removing top features. For Sensor data, SHAP and LIME performed similarly in decreasing model accuracy when removing top features. The DNN model did not show a consistent decline in accuracy on VeReMi data, indicating insufficient features. The security analysts should rely on the majority model behavior, not just DNN. Overall, SHAP exhibited greater descriptive accuracy than LIME on the VeReMi data, but both performed similarly on the Sensor data. Evaluating explanation methods on multiple datasets provides more robust assessment. Figure 4 and 5 shows the descriptive accuracy of SHAP and LIME on VeReMi and Sensor daataset respectively after removal of top fetaures.

2. Sparsity:
Sparsity refers to how many input features are deemed highly relevant by the explanation methods. More sparse explanations are better as they identify a smaller subset of important features.  For the VeReMi dataset, SHAP exhibited higher sparsity than LIME across all 6 models tested.  SHAP showed more exponential growth in sparsity, meaning explanations concentrated on fewer top features.  The area under the curve (AUC) for sparsity was higher for SHAP than LIME for all models, indicating SHAP discarded more irrelevant features.  Higher sparsity for SHAP means analysts need to examine fewer features to understand decisions.  For LIME, lower sparsity meant more features were used in decisions, making it harder to interpret.  For the Sensor dataset, SHAP and LIME performed more similarly in terms of sparsity.  But SHAP still showed slightly higher AUC for sparsity for most models, indicating it was still more sparse.  Overall, SHAP demonstrated higher sparsity and identified a smaller set of influential features than LIME on both datasets. Figure 6 and 7 shows the sparsity of SHAP and LIME on VeReMi and Sensor daataset respectively.

3. Efficiency:
Efficiency refers to the time required to generate explanations by SHAP and LIME. For the multiclass VeReMi dataset, LIME was more efficient than SHAP overall across different sample sizes and models.  However, for lower sample sizes, SHAP was sometimes more efficient for certain models. For 50k samples, SHAP runtime could not be estimated for DNN and SVM models.  Similarly for binary class VeReMi data, LIME was generally more efficient except for 50k SVM samples. For the Sensor dataset, LIME again outperformed SHAP in efficiency for all models and sample sizes.  The Sensor data had up to 10k test samples due to dataset size limitations. Overall, LIME exhibited better computational efficiency and required less time to generate explanations than SHAP. The relative efficiency did depend somewhat on sample size and model complexity.  But in most cases, especially for large samples, LIME provided explanations faster than SHAP for autonomous driving datasets.  This suggests LIME has advantages for efficiently explaining models in time-critical applications like autonomous driving. Table 10 and table 11 is for VeReMi dataset (multicall and binary class) and table 12 is for the efficiency Sensor dataset respectively.
